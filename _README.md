# IMV3 Project Close

## Purpose

The **Inventory Manager v3 (IMV3)** is a simple inventory management CLI tool built to handle basic CRUD operations:
- Add product
- Edit stock
- Delete product
- Show all products
- Save products to CSV

## Features Implemented
- User input validation (int, float, str)
- Basic product management with persistence (CSV file)
- Search by product name
- Sorted display of products by ID
- User-friendly exit reminders with unsaved changes

## Known Limitations
- No search by price, stock, or multi-field search
- No auto-save (requires explicit save action)
- Limited error handling for complex edge cases (invalid input outside basic types)
- No advanced features (e.g. authentication, network support)

## Future Enhancements
- Add product search by price, name, or stock
- Implement sorting by stock or price
- Enhance user interface (UI) for clarity
- Implement password or authentication for access

## Project Status
**Frozen and complete**. No further changes will be made unless required for future development.
